= Why do I need the plugin =
With the plug-in we will generate recommendations in your blog automatically for you if we know anything about the product.  In addition,
this plug-in will always find recommendations for products even if the original link has gone stale.  We've seen links that are more than
5 years old still generating recommendations.

We have a database over over 30,000,000 products and growing that we have analyzed for you so that we can generate the best
recommendations with the highest revenue potential for you

= How do I make money =
If you already have an account on witlee.com, we will notify you when you've reached the revenue threshold and pay you directly over Paypal

= Is there anything I need to do to make this work =
No.  Just continue to create your blog the same way you do today.  We'll find the links on your page and add recommendations automatically.
You can use the links you currently use, or just cut and paste from the retailer page and we'll do the rest.
